Date: 2024-02-26
Creator: Sergio del Amo
Reviewer: Guillermo Calvo

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The issue is to have a list of valid scopes in a single place.

## Decision

Scopes: 

- adr (e.g., architectural design record)
- ci (e.g., change to a GitHub action workflow)
- dep (e.g., dependency upgrade)
- build (e.g., changes to a build file)
- test (e.g. a Pr adding an extra test)
- fix (e.g., a pr with a bug fix and test)
- feat (e.g., extra functionality)
- imp (e.g., improvement to an already existing feature)

## Consequences

Developers should adhere to these scopes.
