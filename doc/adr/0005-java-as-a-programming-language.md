# 5. Java as a Programming Language

Creator: Sergio del Amo

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have to define a programming language to build the application. 

## Decision

We chose Java based on the team's experience. The team already has much experience with Java, and we consider Java robust and stable enough to build the project with it. 

## Consequences

In the future, team members should be familiar with Java, and the deployment and developer tools should support the programming language.
