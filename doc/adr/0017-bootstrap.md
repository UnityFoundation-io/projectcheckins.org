Accepted

## Context


## Decision

We will use [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com) as a CSS framework to simplify the design. Bootstrap components such as Forms and breadcrumbs are a good fit for the application.

The team has experience with Boostrap but barely any with Tailwind.

## Consequences

Some people will consider Bootstrap a nonprofessional choice. Some other alternatives, such as [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), have a catchier design output.
