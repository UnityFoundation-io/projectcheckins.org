# 6. Micronaut as a framework

Date: 2024-02-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to use a Java framework to speed up development.

## Decision

We choose Micronaut as the framework because we consider it mature enough and also the team has expertise with it being the initial members committers of the framework. 

## Consequences

Micronaut Framework is not the most used framework in the JVM, and it may require some onboarding to bring new members into the project.
