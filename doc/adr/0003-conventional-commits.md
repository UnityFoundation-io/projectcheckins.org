# 3. Conventional Commits

Date: 2024-02-26
Creator: Sergio del Amo
Reviewer: Guillermo Calvo

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Create a recognizable commit structure.

## Decision

To use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. The goal is to understand what's changed from looking at the commit history. 

## Consequences

Sometimes, it won't be easy to define the scope of the commitment. We will need to evolve a project list of valid scopes.
