# 2. Push to Master

Date: 2024-02-26
Creator: Sergio del Amo
Reviewer: Guillermo Calvo

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Project creation.

## Decision

In the project's initial phase, we will do pair programming; during the pair programming phase, we will push directly to the main branch. During this phase, we may force push to the repository's history. Later, we will create an ADR to require PRs.

## Consequences

There will be no PR history of the initial commits of the project.
